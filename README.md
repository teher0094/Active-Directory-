# Active Directory User and Access Management Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to manage an Active Directory (AD) environment, specifically focusing on creating and managing users, organizational units (OUs), and groups, and configuring shared folder access permissions.

## Objectives
- **User Creation:** Establish a variety of user accounts in AD.
- **OU Structuring:** Organize users into appropriate Organizational Units.
- **Group Management:** Create and manage groups for different access levels.
- **Shared Folder Access:** Set up shared folders and configure access permissions based on group membership.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Active Directory
- Microsoft Azure
- Windows 10 Pro
- Group Policy Management

## Organizational Units (OUs) and Groups Structuring
- When creating OUs for the first time, I find that a high level approach is best because Active Directory is based on hierarchical structure.
- Starting from the company's name then moving onto the different departments in the company then the groups of each department and finally the users and resources in each group.
- In my project, I created a small company named Americorp which has 11 employees.
- Americorp has 4 departments: Admins, Human Resources, Sales and IT.
- I've created OUs based on each of those departments and a related group within each OU.
- For Human Resources, I created the group called Hiring Team, for the Sales OU, Sales Group, and IT OU, Helpdesk.

### Creating Users and Managing User Properties  
- The Active Directory Users and Computers is a great tool to used when it comes to managing the objects within an AD environment.
- I used ADUC to create 2 Domain Admins and the other 9 were Domain Users.
- The Domain Users were divided into groups of three.
- Each of those user were assigned to the different OU Groups.
- In this project, the user assignments were arbitrary but in the real world, I would have assign the users based on their hired positions.

- In the picture above is an example of the IT OU, the group inside called Helpdesk and the members of that group.
- The users and groups were created using the "Create new user" and "Create new group" buttons. 
- User accounts were created with a temporary password and the option for the users to change password at their next log in was left checked.
