# Active Directory User and Access Management Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to manage an Active Directory (AD) environment, specifically focusing on creating and managing users, organizational units (OUs), and groups, and configuring shared folder access permissions.

## Objectives
- **User Creation:** Establish a variety of user accounts in AD.
- **OU Structuring:** Organize users into appropriate Organizational Units.
- **Group Management:** Create and manage groups for different access levels.
- **Shared Folder Access:** Set up shared folders and configure access permissions based on group membership.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Active Directory
- Microsoft Azure
- Windows 10 Pro
- Group Policy Management

## Organizational Units (OUs) and Groups Structuring

- Outline the strategy for creating OUs.
- Discuss the rationale behind the organization of users into these OUs.
- Detail the process of creating groups in AD.
- Explain how you managed group memberships and their significance.

- When creating OUs for the first time, I find that a high level approach is best because Active Directory is based on hierarchical structure.
- Starting from the company's name then moving onto the different departments in the company then the groups of each department and finally the users and resources in each group.
- In my project, I created a small company named Americorp which has 11 employees.
- Americorp has 4 departments: Admins, Human Resources, Sales and IT.
- I've created OUs based on each of those departments and a related group within each OU.
- For Human Resources, I created the group called Hiring Team, for the Sales OU, Sales Group, and IT OU, Helpdesk.

- I created 2 of the users to be domain admins and the other 9 users were divided into groups of three.
- Each of those groups were assigned to the different OU Groups.
- In this project, the group assignments were arbitrary but in the real world, I would have assign the groups based on their hired position.  

  
## User Creation and Management

### Creating Users
- Steps taken to create new user accounts in AD.
- Include any specific attributes or settings configured for these users.
  
- The Active Directory Users and Computers is a great tool to used when it comes to managing the objects within an AD environment.
- 
- 

### Managing User Properties
- Explain how you managed user properties like passwords, profile paths, and login scripts.


## Shared Folder Access Configuration

### Creating Shared Folders
- Steps to create shared folders on the network.

### Configuring Access Permissions
- Explain how you assigned folder permissions.
- Describe the process of linking folder access to specific OUs or groups.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Discuss any challenges faced during the project.
- Explain how you resolved these challenges.

## Conclusion

- Summarize the key outcomes of the project.
- Reflect on what this experience has taught you about managing an AD environment.
