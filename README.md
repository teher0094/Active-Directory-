# Active Directory User and Access Management Project

## Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to manage an Active Directory (AD) environment, specifically focusing on creating and managing users, organizational units (OUs), and groups, and configuring shared folder access permissions.

## Objectives
- **User Creation:** Establish a variety of user accounts in AD.
- **OU Structuring:** Organize users into appropriate Organizational Units.
- **Group Management:** Create and manage groups for different access levels.
- **Shared Folder Access:** Set up shared folders and configure access permissions based on group membership.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Active Directory
- Microsoft Azure
- Windows 10 Pro

## Organizational Units (OUs) and Groups Structuring

- Outline the strategy for creating OUs.
- Discuss the rationale behind the organization of users into these OUs.
- Detail the process of creating groups in AD.
- Explain how you managed group memberships and their significance.

- When creating OUs for the first time, I find that a high level approach is best because Active Directory is based on hierarchical structure.
- Starting from the company's name then moving onto the different departments in the company then the groups of each department and finally the users and resources in each group.
- In my project, I created a small company named Americorp which has 12 employees.
- Americorp has 4 departments: Admins, Human Resources, Sales and IT.
- I've created OUs based on each of those departments and a related group within each OU.
